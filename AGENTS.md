# AGENTS.md

This file provides guidance to AI coding assistants when working with code in this repository.

**Important**: You **must** follow [these rules](./node_modules/@peerigon/configs/ai/rules.mdc) and its language-specific rules referenced in that file.

## Keeping This File Updated

When you make changes to the project that affect how AI agents should work with the codebase, update this file accordingly. This includes changes to:

- Overall folder structure
- Tech stack (frameworks, libraries, languages)
- npm scripts and development commands
- Testing approaches
- Build and deployment processes

**Important: Keep this file concise**. Only include information that is relevant for most or all development tasks. Omit specific implementation details that don't affect how agents interact with the codebase.

## Development Commands

This project uses npm scripts for all development tasks:

- **Test all**: `npm test` - Runs all tests in parallel (format, lint, types, unit)
- **Unit tests**: `npm run test:unit` - Run Vitest tests once
- **Watch tests**: `npm run vitest` - Run Vitest in watch mode
- **Lint**: `npm run test:lint` - ESLint with zero warnings allowed
- **Type check**: `npm run test:types` - TypeScript compiler check
- **Format check**: `npm run test:format` - Oxfmt format validation

**Important**: Use the typescript-lsp MCP (`getDiagnostics`, `getTypeAtPosition`, `getDefinition`, etc.) for type information
**Important**: Use the vitest-server MCP to run individual tests.
**Important**: Use the eslint MCP to check for linting errors.

## Project Structure

- **Source**: `src/` - All source code and tests
- **Tests**: Co-located with source files using `.test.ts` suffix
- **Configuration**: Uses `@peerigon/configs` for shared TypeScript, ESLint, and Oxfmt configs

## Code Organization

- Functions are implemented in individual files in `src/`
- Each function has comprehensive unit tests using Vitest
- Uses ES module syntax throughout (`.ts` extensions in imports)
- **Environment variables**: Use `src/env.ts`; destructure at top-level module scope so missing vars fail immediately.

## Commit Messages

Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) for all commit messages (e.g. `feat: ...`, `fix: ...`, `chore: ...`). This is enforced by commitlint via a `commit-msg` git hook (`.husky/commit-msg`, config in `commitlint.config.js`) for local feedback, and by `.github/workflows/lint-pr-title.yml`, which lints the PR title in CI — the authoritative check, since `main` uses squash-merge with the PR title as the commit message.

## Template as a git remote

Configure the `template` remote so it can **only be fetched**, never pushed to:

```bash
git remote set-url --push template DISABLED
```

Verify with `git remote -v`: `template` should show a normal fetch URL and `DISABLED` (or empty) for push.

## Opening pull requests

Projects generated from this template usually have a `template` git remote pointing at `peerigon/template` (see "Template as a git remote" above) — whether the project is a literal **GitHub fork** (Option A) or an existing repo that merged the template in (Option B). Either way, `gh` sees a remote pointing at `peerigon/template` and both the web UI's compare page and a fresh `gh` checkout default a new pull request's base to that **upstream** repo. A PR opened that way targets the template, and checks that depend on the project's own repo (CODEOWNERS, rulesets) then fail against the wrong repository.

Run this once per clone of the project's repo:

```bash
gh repo set-default <owner>/<repo>
```

After that `gh pr create` targets the right repo. Verify with `gh repo set-default --view`; if it ever points elsewhere, re-run the command above or use `gh pr create --repo <owner>/<repo>` explicitly.

## Pulling Updates from Template

If the user is asking you to pull in updates from the template repository, follow the steps below.

### Step 1: Merge Template Updates

```bash
git fetch template
git merge --strategy-option theirs --no-commit template/main
```

This will:

- Prefer template files in conflicts (`--strategy-option theirs`)
- Stage changes without committing (`--no-commit`)

### Step 2: Restore Project Specific Files

Restore project-specific files and changes:

- **package.json**: Restore original dependencies but keep the dependency updates from the template repository
- **README.md**: Restore original project documentation
- **AGENTS.md**: Restore project specific instructions and include changes from the template repository
- **src/**: Restore project specific source code and include changes from the template repository
- If a file has been deleted in **this** repository, **do not** restore it from the template repository.

### Step 3: Verify and Clean Up

1. Run `npm install` to update lockfile
2. Run `npm test` to verify everything works
3. Review `git status` and `git diff --staged` for unexpected changes

### Step 4: Stage Changes

**IMPORTANT**: Stage your changes, but **do not commit**. Ask the user to review the changes first.
